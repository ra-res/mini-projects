         <h3 class="employeerole"> I have completed the UI Design course at CareerFoundry and believe the course is the best in terms of relevancy and content. From the online tutors and fellow delegates to the takeaway materials, I have always found that I come away feeling inspired and with valuable new tools and techniques that I can implement into our design activities. I am now doing an UI Design internship at Hot Beans Web which I found to be a learning experience that I thoroughly enjoy.<br>- Andrew, UX/UI Designer at Hot Beans Web </h3>

        <h3 class="employeerole"> I chose to train through the edX as I was aware they are the most reputable organisation for web development training and the course was the most in depth Web Development programme available. The course content was excellent with a good balance between theory and practical application, which I think was a great way to learn. After completing the course, I went for an interview at Hot Beans Web where I was offered an internship position which resulted in a full-time position as a Web Developer.<br>- Susan, Font-end Developer at Hot Beans Web</h3>

        <h3 class="employeerole"> Having just moved into my back-end developer role, my new colleagues who had previously completed the Coursera Database course recommended it to me. The material was very relevant and the course director was flexible in his teaching materials, tailoring the programme to the relevant areas of databases people worked in. I quickly started to apply the skills learned in the course in my job at Hot Web Beans.<br>- Cassandra, Back-end Developer at Hot Beans Web"' </h3>
